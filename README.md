# LoraWAN-Payload-encoder-decoder

## Brief
This repository hosts a header-only library, representing an enhanced version of the original CayenneLPP library. It has been refactored to align with the requirements of the HAN IoT-LAB 23/24 class, focusing on applications within LoRaWAN and The Things Network ecosystems.

This tailored adaptation aims to provide a robust foundation for projects operating in these domains, facilitating a seamless integration and a more efficient deployment process.
